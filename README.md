## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing wedding vendor pricing data to assess its correlation with customer satisfaction and preparing cost-effective wedding proposals. It includes tasks like data collection, database design, SQL-based analysis, and crafting an itemized cost breakdown for a client-selected wedding theme.


Key highlights:
- Explored the relationship between wedding vendor pricing and customer satisfaction using data-driven insights.
- Designed and normalized a database in 3NF, representing wedding vendor details and cost data.
- Developed dynamic SQL queries and Python scripts to generate detailed cost breakdowns for clients.
- Provided actionable insights for cost-effective wedding planning.

The project demonstrates advanced skills in database design, SQL, and Python for business analysis and client engagement.


## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Data modeling, normalization, and query generation
- **Python**: Dynamic cost breakdown generation and data processing
- **Excel**: Data collection and reporting
- **PowerPoint**: Client-ready presentations
- **Database Design**: ER diagram creation and data structuring
