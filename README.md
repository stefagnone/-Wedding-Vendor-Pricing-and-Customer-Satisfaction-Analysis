## Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between wedding vendor pricing and customer satisfaction. Using data-driven insights and advanced analytics, I explored whether investing in higher-priced wedding services guarantees higher customer satisfaction. The analysis challenges traditional assumptions and provides actionable recommendations for wedding consultants.

The analysis focused on:
- Evaluating vendor pricing categories (inexpensive, affordable, moderate, and luxury) against customer satisfaction ratings.
- Leveraging SQL for data preparation and Python for statistical modeling and visualization.
- Generating actionable insights for client proposals and service optimizations.

This project demonstrates expertise in SQL, Python, and business consulting in the wedding industry.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Data preparation, temporary table creation, and category segmentation.
- **Python**: Data analysis, visualization, and dynamic wedding cost breakdown generation.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and processing.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Advanced visualizations.
- **Microsoft PowerPoint**: Final client proposal and presentation.

## Repository Structure
- `Data/`: Contains the SQL queries and temporary tables used in data preparation.
- `Code/`: Includes the Jupyter Notebook for Python-based analysis and cost breakdown (`wedding_cost_analysis.ipynb`).
- `Presentation/`: Final presentation slides (`Wedding Vendor Analysis - Final Presentation.pdf`) and unlisted YouTube link.
- `Results/`: Contains final analysis results and insights.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Access the `Data/` folder to review the SQL queries and temporary tables.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`wedding_cost_analysis.ipynb`) in the `Code/` folder to explore the analysis and dynamic cost breakdowns.
4. Review the final presentation in the `Presentation/` folder for a comprehensive overview of findings.
