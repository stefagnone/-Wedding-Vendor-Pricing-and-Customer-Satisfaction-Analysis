/*Creating the relevant vendors table to inlcude outdoor and garden as primary venue option but
also add 'terrace' and 'winery' as posiible alternatives. We also filtered to ensure photo and video 
taken my profesional photographer and not a person with an iphone. To fit the white cake into the theme
we filtered cake vendors to offer vanilla, lemon, and white cakes. We also filterd to inlcude vednors that
offered tower cakes to fit the one-to-two tierd cake for the theme but also those who offered faux_display 
in case the cake was going to be for show and guests would then eat a different cake. In addition to fit the
theme we ensured cake vendors were also able to fit with vegetarian and vegan diets.
We also filtered to have hair and makeup be a packaged togehter. Rentals had to offer everything neccessary 
to decorate the venue if neccessary, this included; decor, lighting, linen, tables, chairs, and tableware.
All other options could fit the theme as they offer the basic necceties for the theme. 

Budget level matched for the corresposing price_id, but for size all vendors could fit into each size. We decided 
to match wedding size based on invitations minimum; since venue capacity was way over the large size venues
was not the best fit to identify size. In the data if a wedding states large it can also host small and medium 
weddings as well.

/* Assumptions: As not all vendors are available across different price ranges, such as the absence of luxury flower vendors, 
we've compiled the temporary vendor table below using estimates gathered from various sources on multiple pages. Given the diverse services vendors offer,
it's important to understand that the estimated prices may deviate from the affordable price range previously categorized by other departments.
Our evaluations are based on vendors showcasing images in line with the proposed natural and forest theme for the wedding, 
contributing to a more precise estimate than the initial database. For instance, a wedding dress precisely matching the vision board might
fall outside the average price range considered for the specific vendor. The table finds twelve combinations of budget levels and wedding sizes,
spanning all relevant departments. Venues were the anchor point in vendor selection, chosen for their compatibility with the suggested outdoor theme.
